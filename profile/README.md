# The Twelve-Factor Organization

This organization manages the open-source version of the twelve-factor
manifesto, which will ultimately replace the one hosted at
[12factor.net](https://12factor.net). Changes are happening in the
[twelve-factor repository](https://github.com/twelve-factor/twelve-factor).
